# ball-rolling-game

This is a game created with the Unity game engine in which you control a ball! It's my first "real" game!

In this game, the player controls a ball with the arrow keys (or WASD) to push it into a hole. However, there are many obstacles along the path.
In most levels, the path is a little narrow and falling off is lethal, so you have to maneuver the ball carefully.
Of course, there's a time limit! If there wasn't, you could take forever to finish a level by being super careful. This forces you to hurry up.
You'll also find objects that you can push around, moving platforms, and enemies that kill you upon impact. 

This game's art style is very simplistic since most objects are standard 3D shapes and are only one color. This allows the player to easily understand how an object behaves simply by it's color (color code).
